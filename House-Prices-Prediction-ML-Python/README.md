Project Overview
-----------
In this project, we will predict future house prices. We have Federal Reserve and Zillow data. We will merge and combine this data, then use a random forest model to train test.

Steps:
- Load data
- Clean and Merge
- Create an initial machine learning model and estimate accuracy
- Improve the accuracy of the model
- Run diagnostics to figure out how we can improve
